8. flying drone and filming it
9. writing GNSS, Radio/Transmitter, Smoke stopper, props/battery charger, reciever/transmitter, battery, motor test, compass callibration, road to first flight
10. adding the pictures

### Questions
- How to cite a picture/the source of the picture?
- What should be in the caption of the picture?
- How should the links be sorted? Because I don't think having them sorted from their dates is a good option.
## Week 7.10-13-10

2. trying to get the transmitter connection to the receiver works but not to mission planner or the Fc
3. receiver transmitter works
4. connecting battery to esc via smoke stopper works fine
5. changing parameters to see voltage and amperage on MP
6. compass calibration fail due to no GPS lock
7. compass calibration works(no idea why, probably large vehicle mag cal)
8. soldering one of the Motor cables, because it fell off
9. magfield problems
10. arming on my table after disabling arming_check

### Open Questions
- I will write a message per teams tomorrow.(14.10) with them
